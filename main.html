    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, making them suitable for large inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size.</p>
