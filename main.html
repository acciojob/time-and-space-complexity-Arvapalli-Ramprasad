	 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational efficiency of an algorithm, measuring how the runtime grows with the input size. Efficient algorithms typically have lower time complexities.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It is often expressed in Big O notation, such as <i>O(n)</i>, indicating the relationship between input size and space usage.</p>
