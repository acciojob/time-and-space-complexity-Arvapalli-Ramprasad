    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
Time complexity in Java measures the execution time of an algorithm relative to its input size. It predicts the growth of computation time as input size increases. Common complexities include O(1) (constant time), O(n) (linear time), O(log n) (logarithmic time), and O(n^2) (quadratic time). Java's efficient handling of arrays, collections, and loops helps manage time complexity. For example, accessing an element in an array is O(1), while iterating over an array is O(n). Understanding time complexity helps in writing efficient code by allowing developers to predict and optimize the performance of their algorithm</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b>in Java refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run relative to its input size. It includes both the fixed part (memory used by the code, variables, etc.) and the variable part (memory used by dynamic allocations like arrays, objects). Common space complexities are O(1) (constant space), O(n) (linear space), and O(n^2) (quadratic space). For instance, a loop using a fixed number of variables is O(1), while storing elements in a list is O(n). Managing space complexity is crucial for optimizing memory usage, especially in applications with large datasets or constrained environments.</p>
