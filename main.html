	<h1>Time and Spacee Complexity in Java</h1>
	<p>Time complexity in Java measures how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input, usually expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n)). It helps determine the efficiency and performance of code by predicting how an algorithm's execution time will grow relative to the input size.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity </b>in Java quantifies the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input, often represented in Big O notation (e.g., O(1), O(n)). It considers both the auxiliary space used by the algorithm and the space required for the input itself.</p>
